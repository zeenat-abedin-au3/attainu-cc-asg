<p>
    This is a brief introduction about myself.
    Well I would start introducing myself with my name. My name is Zeenat and I live in Kolkata, India. 
    I'm a 23 year old aspirant web developer. I did my graduation in computer science.
    I am eager to learn new skills in life despite the fact that I'm a slow learner.
    A highly organized and hard-working individual looking for securing a challenging position in a reputable organization to expand my learnings, knowledge, and skills.
    Apart from being career oriented I'm of a very approachable, friendly and engaging nature and love to be with people who aren't selfish. 
    Also, I love travelling and meeting new people to get a whole new perspective altogether. I wish to travel the whole world. 
    Hope all my dreams will sync one day.
